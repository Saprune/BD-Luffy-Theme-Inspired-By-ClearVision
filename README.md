# BD-Luffy-Theme-Inspired-By-ClearVision
A BetterDiscord Theme I made from clearvision. To use this theme go into the code and copy all of it and paste it into the custom CSS category in the settings under the category betterdiscord. After you paste it in press save then the reload button next to it. Make sure to disable other themes before using it or it might be buggy.

Press the Custom CSS and paste it in.
